# Data Alchemist: A Modular Universal Data Conversion Framework

---

## Overview

**Data Alchemist** is a robust, modular data conversion framework designed to automatically detect and process a wide variety of input data files, transforming them into user-selectable structured output formats. Built to serve as a universal preprocessing tool, it supports diverse inputs such as CSV files, WAV audio, PNG/JPEG images, and plain text logs, converting these into formats like JSON and CSV with clean separation of concerns. This ensures flexibility, extensibility, and scalability, making it ideal for downstream data pipelines that require easy integration and future expandability.

This project offers an immersive educational experience targeting intermediate developers who want to deepen their understanding of software design patterns, plugin-based architectures, and file format heuristics. Users will practice practical skills like file type autodetection, parsing heterogeneous data types, and modular serialization without relying on external AI services. The scope is designed for a 2-3 week development timeline, providing a manageable yet challenging medium-complexity project that includes thorough testing and documentation.

By the end of this project, learners will have built a polished CLI tool embodying clean architecture principles and extensible plugin mechanisms while gaining invaluable insight into file I/O, parsing, and data serialization techniques that are cornerstone skills in software and data engineering.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend / CLI:** Python  
  *Why:* Python offers mature libraries for file I/O, data processing, and modular programming, making it ideal for plugin-based architectures and diverse data parsing. It also supports rapid prototyping and ease of use.  
  *Alternatives considered:* JavaScript (Node.js), Go, but less optimal for rapid parsing prototyping and rich scientific libraries.  
  *Learning resources:* Python’s official docs, Real Python tutorials on CLI development and plugin systems.

- **Storage / Output:** JSON and CSV files  
  *Why:* JSON and CSV are widely-used, open formats for structured data, easy to consume by downstream processes.  
  *Alternatives considered:* XML, YAML – more complex or less universally supported for this project's scope.

- **Special Libraries:**  
  - `argparse`: For CLI argument parsing and help text.  
  - `pathlib`: Modern file system path handling.  
  - `json`: Native JSON serialization support.  
  - `pandas`: Efficient CSV handling and data frames.  
  - `scipy` (for WAV parsing): Reliable audio processing tools.  
  - `Pillow` (PIL fork for images): Robust image file parsing.

**Framework Rationale:**  
This stack was chosen to balance accessibility with power. Python’s ecosystem supports the essential parsing and conversion tasks without external AI dependencies, aligning with the educational goals of demonstrating clean architecture and modular design. The selected libraries minimize boilerplate enabling focus on core logic, teaching patterns rather than tool complexity.

## Architecture Overview

**Data Alchemist** is built around a clean **plugin-based modular architecture** with strict separation of concerns, enabling extensibility and maintenance:

- **File Type Detection Module:** Uses heuristic analyzers to identify file formats via signature bytes or pattern matching.
- **Parser Plugins:** Independent plugins implementing a common parser interface ingest detected file formats and extract raw data into intermediate structured models.
- **Converter Plugins:** Separate plugins adhere to a converter interface to transform intermediate data into various output formats like JSON or CSV.
- **Plugin Manager:** Dynamic registry that loads, registers, and manages parser and converter plugins, facilitating discovery and extensibility.
- **Command-Line Interface (CLI):** Orchestrates the workflow—detection, parsing, conversion, and output—exposing user-friendly commands and options.
- **Core Data Models:** Standardized intermediate representation objects ensuring consistent data interchange between plugins.

### Data Flow:

```
[Input File/Blob]
       ↓
[File Type Detection Module]
       ↓
[Parser Plugin (based on detection)]
       ↓
[Intermediate Data Model]
       ↓
[Converter Plugin (user-selected output format)]
       ↓
[Output File (JSON/CSV)]
```

### Key Design Patterns:

- **Plugin Pattern:** To enable independent development and injection of parsers and converters.
- **Strategy Pattern:** For flexible selection of detection, parsing, and conversion algorithms.
- **Separation of Concerns:** Clear modular boundaries between detection, parsing, and conversion components.
- **Command Pattern:** CLI commands encapsulating operations and argument parsing.
